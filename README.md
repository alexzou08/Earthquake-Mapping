# Java-EarthquakeMapping
This is a coursera course project.
[Link to the Course](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/object-oriented-programming)

This project organizes the earthquake data from World Bank, shows it on google map, and compute statistics on it.

## Code design
Add and Implement the private method void sortAndPrint(int numToPrint) in EarthquakeCityMap.  This method will create a new array from the list of earthquake markers (hint: there is a method in the List interface named toArray() which returns the elements in the List as an array of Objects).  Then it will sort the array of earthquake markers in reverse order of their magnitude (highest to lowest) and then print out the top numToPrint earthquakes.    If numToPrint is larger than the number of markers in quakeMarkers, it should print out all of the earthquakes and stop, but it should not crash.Call this method from setUp() to test it.  An example input and output files are provided in the data folder: use test2.atom as the input file, and sortandPrint.test2.out.txt is the expected output for a couple different calls to sortAndPrint.

## What I have learned
* Define the scope of variables and methods
* Extend existing libraries to build a medium-sized project
* Build and work with a class hierarchy that has multiple levels
* Author code which implements an Interface
* Explain the difference between compile-time and run-time
* Explain and implement the binary search algorithm
* Define and use the Comparable interface in Java
